 # First Milestone

  
The first milestone was done in 2023 with the construction of the car and using UltraSonic module. This allowed the Car to indepedently change course and avoid collosions. Ultra sonic works by sending high fequency soundwaves to bounce off to act as a distance measurement allowing the robot to independently judge the distance btween the source of the ultrasonic waves(the front of the robot) and whatever is in front of the robot. This using the variable of the safe distance determines when it needs to move away.

# Second Milestone

The 2nd Milestone done in October/November 2024 I was able to perform was converting the Obstocal avoidance car into a IR Remote control while minimizing replacment parts.
Using the Infrared Wavelength and the same operating princple of a TV remote. Using pulses of Infared light to the IR reciver translate into binary for the CPU Motherboard using this it takes this data and applies it to the code I provided to the device to via an H bridge send electircal singinals that turn the 2 dual gear electric tt motors.

# Third Milestone 

The 3rd Milestone done in December 2024 was to incorporate a Laser that can turn off an on with the I.R. remote as mentioned
prevouisly. A L.A.S.E.R. works by amplifying light into as small of a point as possible in a beam. This laser units wiring is a copy of the L.E.D. wiring, this also means the led function can be used as the base the function for the laser. making adding the laser to the Arduino ports and breadboard relativly simple.
